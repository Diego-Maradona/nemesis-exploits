# Nemesis project

# About

I've been looking for a good set of tools for kahoots. However, this proved to be difficult, as literally every single one of them was broken, or somewhat difficult to use or install. Recently, however, I found a NPM package and used some of the source from that to build my own set of tools, known as 'Nemesis'.

Currently, it contains:
- Bot flood
- Magic eye
- (more in the works soon)

Note that this is very early in development, so expect bugs.

# How to install

Windows

1. Install node.js on your system. Find the latest version at https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.13.1/node-v12.13.1-x86.msi.

2. Open a new console window. This can be easly done by going over to your search bar in the bottom left and typing 'cmd'. A icon for a command console will appear somewhere in the search box. Click on that to open up a new console.

3. Enter the following commands:

'cd C:/' - This will change your directory to your hard drive, or whatever directory you want to install it on.

'npm install kahoot.js-updated' - This installs the NPM package on your system. 

'git clone https://github.com/Devteam-82/nemesis-exploits/' - Clones this directory to your computer so you can run the scripts

'cd nemesis-exploits' - Changes to the git you cloned

'cd scripts' - Changes directory to scripts

After that, you should be able to run 'node (script name)', it should be able to run, provided you have filled in the requred info inside the script.
