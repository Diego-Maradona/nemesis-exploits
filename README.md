# Nemesis project
Tools for exploitation of kahoots
Created by Dr. Apostle, AKA Devteam-82

# About

I've been looking for a good set of tools for kahoots. However, this proved to be difficult, as literally every single one of them was broken, or somewhat difficult to use or install. Recently, however, I found a NPM package and used some of the source from that to build my own set of tools, known as 'Nemesis'.

Currently, it contains:
- Bot flood
- Magic eye
- (more in the works soon)

Note that this is very early in development, so expect bugs.

# How to install

**Linux
```bash
# Clone the git

git clone https://github.com/Devteam-82/nemesis-exploits
# CD to git
cd nemesis-exploits

# Install required assets(Make sure to supply creds!)
sudo bash install.sh

# After that is finished, cd to the scripts directory
cd scripts

# Change scripts to your preference, and you are all set!

node flood.js
```
